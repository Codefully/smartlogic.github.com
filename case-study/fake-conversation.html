<p>Our client Dr. Strange App created "Fake Conversation," an app with over 3 million downloads that lets people stage fake conversations for fun. We worked with Dr. Strange App to build a new application that would work well with the latest version of iOS. We migrated their data to the new app, and integrated it with Flurry, an IOS analytics and advertising SDK.</p>
