          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>The main goal of creating an empathy map is to align stakeholders and to establish a baseline user we are targeting when we move on to journey mapping. We start an Empathy Mapping session by individually reviewing any previously performed market research. Then each person (including a participating developer) takes time to write out on a sticky note, certain aspects of this user. The completed empathy map in of itself is a great artifact and point of reference; we also use it to also create a proto-persona, which helps to further illustrate just who this primary user is.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>With a Journey Map, we define a set of steps a user takes to complete a goal along with several questions we ask as a team for each defined step, including pains, gains, what the user needs to move on to the next step, questions they have, how they’re feeling. We use the journey map to focus on the user’s journey, so we can make strong UX decisions. Additional business-side concerns may emerge but they are not the focus of the journey map and we try to keep the conversation focused on the user’s perspective. This is also an opportunity to shift focus from all the features the app could have to the features critical to the user’s ability to successfully complete a goal. The finished journey map becomes the foundation for our wireframes and prototype.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>Next, we design the micro-wireframes in Whimsical, which are something of a cross between a user flow and an actual wireframe. The idea is to start thinking about the interactions in each step without putting too much thought into the layout, placement, and look and feel of each feature. Micro-wireframes are a great way to map out the screens we’ll need to design and the flows we want in a quick and iterative way. This process is pretty collaborative, with much back-and-forth with the client before we land on the final flows.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>Once we agree on a final version of the wireframes we move on to designing the high-resolution mockups in Sketch. Once a few initial mockups are approved, we design the rest and move on to building an interactive screen-based prototype. We build our prototype in InVision since we can easily turn it around and iterate on it quickly as well. The clickable prototype for us is not coded; the more we can test, clarify, and refine the design before beginning to code, the quicker we’ll get to a great functioning app. Structural changes are relatively easy in a design tool and much more time-intensive (and costly) once the coding has started.</p>

      <h2>We test our (and your) assumptions early and often.</h2>

      <p>Our approach generally is to be agile where possible, iterate, do our discovery and test our assumptions when we can to minimize the change of surprises and overages during development.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, our goal is to go with the most educated guess and to test the assumption hypothesis from the designer and stakeholder. Inevitably, testing will prove some of our assumptions wrong, which is a good thing. It should allow you to pivot and make the correction before any costly development has been done. We’ll tweak as best we can, given the amount of time we have, knowing that we’ll never get the design perfect. But if we've done our job right there will be less re-work and re-factoring down the line.
