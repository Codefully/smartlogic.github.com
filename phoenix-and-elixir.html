  <h2>Next-gen tools for building modern, scalable web applications.</h2>

  <p><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. First released in September 2014, Elixir has quickly become one of the most promising languages available for modern web applications. Elixir is built on <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, a language originally designed in the 1980’s to address fault-tolerance and concurrency needs for telephone systems, and inherits its scalability and stability from BEAM, the Erlang Virtual Machine.</p>

  <p>Phoenix is a framework for Elixir, much like Rails is for Ruby; it is a toolset for building highly performant and scalable web applications. Phoenix is very fast, generating response times measured in microseconds, and its patterns provide a good balance of quick-to-build and easy-to-maintain code.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Elixir are a great choice for web applications that need to scale up. <a href="https://codesync.global/media/successful-companies-using-elixir-and-erlang/">Examples of some high profile web applications</a> built in Elixir and Erlang include <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">What’sApp</a>, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">BleacherReport</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.adroll.com/">AdRoll</a>, <a href="https://www.grindr.com/">Grindr</a>, and <a href="https://www.bet365.com/en/">Bet365</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="we-ve-been-building-in-phoenix-and-elixir-since-the-beginning-">We’ve been building in Phoenix and Elixir since the beginning.</h2>

  <p>We have had Phoenix and Elixir projects in production since 2015, for clients including <a href="https://smartlogic.io/case-study/stanley-black-and-decker">Stanley Black and Decker</a>, UnDigital, and the <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2018/11/19/smartlogic-propels-digital-transformation-aboard-baltimore-water-taxi/">Baltimore Water Taxi</a>.</p>
