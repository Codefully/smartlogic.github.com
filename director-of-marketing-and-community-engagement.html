  <h3>Expectations of You and Your Background / Experience</h3>
  <p>Things we expect of the person that will take this job (and the criteria by which we’ll evaluate job candidates):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Demonstrated marketing experience: we are not seeking a “junior” or “intro” level employee for this position. We do not have staff with extensive marketing experience and are not in a position to train someone. Therefore we need you to have demonstrated experience in marketing strategy and execution. While we do not expect you to know everything and have every skill right now, we do expect you to be able to quickly learn on the job.</li>
    <li>Organized: we value organization and are very organized. The person that will work well in this role will be highly organized.</li>
    <li>Strong interpersonal communication: we need someone that is a team player and that doesn’t get on the defensive or take things personally. Our objective as a team is simply to do the best possible work.</li>
    <li>Effective communicator: good organization and good communication means the information your other team members need will always be at their fingertips (through various docs, spreadsheets, third party websites, etc.).</li>
    <li>Self-starter, entrepreneurial: we don’t micromanage. We work as a team to brainstorm ideas—but you need to bring your own ideas to the table too. We’re a very creative group and do things our own way—you’ll be expected to bring new ideas, processes, and approaches to the table for execution.</li>
    <li>Creative: new ideas are welcome. We are small and nimble and fast to do things—experimentation is encouraged!</li>
    <li>Work hard, play hard: our team has a very good work ethic. But everyone on the team also has a strong personality, and strong personal life.</li>
    <li>Be technical: while we don’t expect you to be a front or back-end developer we do expect you to have solid footing in the world of web and mobile application development. More importantly, you should have a genuine curiosity for software development, design, and programming; we can guarantee that you will learn a tremendous amount by working with our team.</li>
  </ol>
