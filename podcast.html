        <h2>Season One: Elixir in Production</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Our first season, released from February-April of 2019, focused on Elixir in production and featured conversations with engineers who have live production apps built with Elixir. We talked about why Elixir, implementation details, libraries, patterns, and tips for real-world applications.

        <h2>Elixir in Production: Takeaways and Common Themes</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the common themes that emerged through our conversations with the developers we interviewed in season one:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone we interviewed had fairly similar reasons for picking Elixir. They loved that it was concurrent, highly available, and fault tolerant. The great developer tooling was icing on the cake.</li>
          <li>A majority of the developers we spoke with host their Elixir applications on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> or some kind of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> host. But don't let that intimidate you, Elixir also runs great on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</li>
          <li>We also asked everyone for a single tip for getting your new application deployed and a lot of them responded with "Just give it a go and have fun!" While it seems complicated to deploy Elixir right now, getting the experience and having something deployed, no matter how you get it there, is worth doing.</li>
        </ul>
