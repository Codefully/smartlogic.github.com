  <h2>A modern framework for native app development.</h2>

  <p>First released in early 2015, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native</a> is an open source framework designed and maintained by the team at <a href="https://github.com/facebook">Facebook</a>. React Native allows developers to use the idioms and tools of <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, a flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to build native mobile applications.
  Unlike earlier cross-platform development options, React Native uses native platform-specific interface components, giving apps a natural look and feel and great performance. React Native also allows developers to make changes and optimizations in the platform-native code, or to write whole components in Swift, Java, or Objective-C as needed.</p>

  <p>React Native has serious advantages from a development perspective; like React, it is declarative and component-based, and when used with our preferred tools like <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> and <a href="https://redux-saga.js.org/">Sagas</a>, React Native code is extremely readable. Because it uses JavaScript, one of the most commonly used web languages, it is also a framework easily accessible to developers throughout the world.</p>

  <p>React Native reduces duplication of code and improves maintainability and scalability for cross-platform applications by allowing for the re-use of most styling and all of the business logic needed for iOS and Android apps. A number of high-profile apps use React Native, including Facebook, Instagram, Uber, Skype, Salesforce, Baidu, and Soundcloud.</p>

  <h2 id="we-ve-used-react-native-to-build-everything-from-prototypes-to-large-scale-applications-">We’ve used React Native to build everything from prototypes to large-scale applications.</h2>

  <p>We’ve been building in React Native since 2016, and it continues to be our favorite framework for mobile app development. In the recent past we’ve used React Native to deliver apps for the Baltimore Water Taxi, SpotCrime, Brainchild, and Revolve Wellness Studios.</p>
